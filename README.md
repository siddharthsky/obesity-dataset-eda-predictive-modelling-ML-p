About
-----

This repository contains code for Exploratory Data Analysis and building predictive models to predict obesity using machine learning techniques on a dataset containing information about individuals such as their weight, height, age, gender etc.

Dataset
-------

The dataset contains information about various measurements of participants. The columns in the dataset are:

**Attributes related with eating habits are:**

- Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC),
- Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC),
- Number of main meals (NCP),
- Consumption of food between meals (CAEC),
- Consumption of water daily (CH20),
- and Consumption of alcohol (CALC).

**Attributes related with the physical condition are:**

- Calories consumption monitoring (SCC),
- Physical activity frequency (FAF),
- Time using technology devices (TUE),
- Transportation used (MTRANS),

**Other variables were:**

- Gender, Age, Height and Weight.
