About
-----

This repository contains code for Exploratory Data Analysis and building predictive models to predict obesity using machine learning techniques on a dataset containing information about individuals such as their weight, height, age, gender etc.

Dataset
-------

The dataset contains information about various physical measurements of participants. The columns in the dataset are:

*   Weight: Weight of the participant (lbs)
*   Height: Height of the participant (inches)
*   Age: Age of the participant (years)
*   Gender: Gender of the participant (Male/Female)
*   BMI: BMI of the participant (calculated from weight and height)
*   Abdomen Circumference: Abdominal circumference of the participant (inches)
*   Glucose: Glucose level of blood (mg/dl)
*   BloodPressure: Blood pressure level (mm hg)
*   SkinThickness: Skin thickness (mm)
*   Insulin: Insulin level of blood (mu U/ml)
*   Diabetes: Has diabetes (0/1)
*   Obesity: Is obese (0/1, target variable)
